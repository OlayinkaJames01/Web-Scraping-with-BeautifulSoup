# Web-Scraping-with-BeautifulSoup
Leveraged web scraping using the beautifulSoup python library to gather data on python related jobs posted on TimesJobs recruitment platform "few days ago" and embeds the result in a file for ease of applying for those jobs.

The code scraps the TimeJobs page for python opportunities and send to my mail every 24hrs.
